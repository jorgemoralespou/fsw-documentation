== Architecture - Topologies
* Simple topology (All in one)
* Environmental topology
* Environmental topology with unified governance

== Simple topology (All in one)
This topology deploys all the functions in the same boxes, a set of 2 or more boxes (to have clustering) and it is not recommended as the production approach, but rather for PoC and demoing.

This topology is a simple topology and will consist of:

* A cluster of servers for SwitchYard, rtGov + dtGov.
* We will typically front this cluster with a Load Balancer. For this we usually have two options, a Hardware load balancer (typically this is clustered) or an httpd+mod_cluster (usually in an HA manner, A/A or A/P)
* We also have a cluster of databases (amongst those supported by the product) in a clustered way, for HA.

Httpd servers and database servers ca be co-located on the same boxes as the FSW servers, so reducing the required amount of boxes needed for this.

We need to take into account for this topology additional constraints such as:

* Having a separate messaging topology included in the solution and connected from SwitchYard clusters via JMS bridge or ActiveMQ/HornetQ jca adapter.
* Having shared storage for file based type of services

== Environmental topology
This topology deploys every function into every existing environment in a clustered manner per functionality.

In every environment we will have:

* A large cluster of servers for SwitchYard (this servers include rtGov client) that will do the service execution.
* We will typically front this cluster with a Load Balancer. For this we usually have two options, a Hardware load balancer (typically this is clustered) or an httpd+mod_cluster (usually in an HA manner, A/A or A/P)
* A cluster of RTGov servers (for HA) that will be doing runtime governance analisys. This cluster will be A/P and accessed through a VIP.
* We also have a cluster of databases (amongst those supported by the product) in a clustered way, for HA.
* A cluster for Design Time Governance that will orchestrate the state of services in that environment. Promotion of artifacts amongst environments will be done manually, and thus the solely purpose of this DTGov cluster in the environment is to provide with the S-RAMP storage capabilities for artifacts and metadata.

Usually these environments (dev, qa, test, stage, preprod, prod,...) will not be the same in terms of size and capabilities, so Development environment tends to be much smaller in terms of number of boxes and capabilities of those boxes (cores/cpus, ram,...).

== Environmental topology with unified governance
This topology deploys clusters of main functions per existing environment and shares a common layer (cluster/environment) for design time governance (DTGov) responsibilities.

* We also have a cluster of databases (amongst those supported by the product) in a clustered way, for HA.
 
Also, we will lie down a shared environment for Design Time Governance that will orchestrate the state of services between the different environments. This environment is one single environment and can be co-located in any of the other environments, and then making advantage of the load balancing and database capabilities already available in that environment.

== Adding ActiveMQ
Usually, when adding to the architecture a messaging broker, you would like to add it in a HA way, and running in separate processes.

There are multiple ways of adding a messaging broker (master/slave, network of brokers,...) but all of them, if using ActiveMQ, requires that the communication between FSW (SwitchYard) and the messaging brokers is done with the ActiveMQ JCA resource adapter.

== Complete FSW stack
This topology deploys clusters of main functions per existing environment and shares a common layer (cluster/environment) for design time governance (DTGov) responsibilities.

* A cluster of management and monitoring servers with JBoss OperationNetwork (JON)
