== SwitchYard - SCA

 SwitchYard is a component-based development framework focused on building structured, maintainable services and applications using the concepts and best practices of SOA. It works with Apache Camel to provide a fast, simple, flexible integration runtime with comprehensive connectivity and transports. A uniform application model augments Apache Camel, joining Java EE, BPM, rules, orchestration, and routing into a cohesive development model and runtime. Common functionality and cross-cutting concerns - validation, transformation and policy - are isolated from business logic and handled declaratively. This ensures consistency and eliminates duplication, offering developers a clear view of the structure and relationships of services in an integration application.

== Composite
A composite is displayed as a light blue rectangle and represents the boundary between what's inside your application and what's outside your application. A SwitchYard application consists of exactly one composite that has a name and a targetNamespace. The targetNamespace value is important as it allows names defined locally in the application (e.g. service names) to be qualified and unique within a SwitchYard runtime.

== Component
A component is a modular container for application logic and consists of the following:

* 0 or 1 component service definitions
* 0 to many component reference definitions
* 1 implementation

Services and references allow a component to interact with other components, while the implementation provides the actual logic for providing and/or consuming services.

image::component.jpg[component]

[source,xml]
----
<sca:component name="Routing">
</sca:component>
----

== Implementation
An implementation acts as the 'brain' of a service component and it is how implement your application logic. The following implementation options are available:

* *Bean*: allows a CDI Bean to consume or provide services using annotations.
* *Camel*: EIP-style routing and service composition using the XML or Java DSL in Apache Camel.
* *BPMN 2*: service orchestration and human task integration expressed as BPMN 2 and executed using jBPM.
* *BPEL Process*: web service orchestration using the OASIS Business Process Execution Language.
* *Rules*: decision services based on Drools.

Implementations are private to a component, which means external consumers and providers are not aware of the details of a component's implementation (implementation-hiding).  All interactions with other components within an application and with external services are handled through component services and references.

== Component Service
A component service is used to expose the functionality of an implementation as a service. All component services have a contract, which can be a Java interface, WSDL portType definition, or a set of named data types (interface.esb). Component services are private to an application, which means a component service can only be invoked by other components in the same application. In order to expose a component service to consumers external to the application, a component service can be 'promoted' to a composite service. A component service can be promoted multiple times to create different composite services.

      <sca:interface.java interface="org.example.ServiceA"/>
   </sca:service>
</sca:component>
----

== Composite Service
A composite service represents an application service which is visible to other applications. A composite service can only be realized by promoting a component service within the application. The name and the interface of the composite service can be different from the component service. If the interface, or contract, of the composite service is different from the component service, be aware that a transformation may be required to map between the types defined in each interface. In our example application, the component service has a Java interface while the composite service has a WSDL interface. This means we would need to declare a transformer which maps between XML and Java to resolve the data type mismatch.

      <sca:interface.wsdl interface="ServiceA.wsdl#wsdl.porttype(ServiceAPortType)"/>
   </sca:service>
</sca:composite>
----

== Service Binding
A service binding is used to define an access method for a composite service. Composite services can have multiple bindings, which allows a single service to be accessed in different ways. In most cases, a service binding represents a protocol/transport adapter (e.g. SOAP, JMS, REST). An important exception to this rule is the SCA binding, which allows services across applications in the same runtime to be wired together in memory. Regardless of the underlying binding details, a binding must always be used to facilitate inter-application communication in SwitchYard.

      <soap:binding.soap>
        <soap:wsdl>ServiceA.wsdl</soap:wsdl>
      </soap:binding.soap>
   </sca:service>
</sca:composite>
----

== Component Reference
A component reference allows a component to consume other services. A component reference can be wired to a service offered by another component in the same application or it can be wired to services outside the application via a composite reference. Similar to component services, all component references have a contract with allows a component to invoke services without knowing implementation or binding details. The picture below shows an example of wiring a reference on the Routing component to a service offered by the Bean component.

   </sca:service>
   <sca:reference name="ServiceC">
      <sca:interface.java interface="org.example.ServiceC"/>
   </sca:reference>
</sca:component>
----

== Composite Reference
A composite reference allows a component reference to be wired to a service outside the application. Similar to composite services, bindings are used with composite references to specify the communication method for invoking the external service.

   </sca:reference>
</sca:composite>
----

== Reference Bindings
A reference binding is used to define an access method for an external service via a composite reference. Unlike service bindings, there can only be one binding for each composite reference. The set of bindings available for references is identical to the set of bindings available for services, although the configuration values for a given binding may be different depending on whether it's used as a service binding or a reference binding.

 TODO: Create this

== Switchyard - Bean Component
The Bean Component is a pluggable container in SwitchYard which allows Java classes (or beans) to provide and consume services. This means that you can implement a service by simply annotating a Java class. It also means you can consume a service by injecting a reference to that service directly into your Java class

 TODO: Create this

== SwitchYard - Creating a Bean service
To create a new Bean service you only need a few pieces of information:

* *Name*: the name of the Java class for your bean service.
* *Service Name*: the name of the service your bean will provide.
* *Interface*: the contract for the service being provided.  Java is the only valid interface type for bean services.

[source,java]
----

package com.example.switchyard.docs;
 
import org.switchyard.component.bean.Service;
 
@Service(Example.class)
public class ExampleBean implements Example {
 
}
----

The @Service annotation allows the SwitchYard CDI Extension to discover your bean at runtime and register it as a service. The value of the annotatio represents the service contract for the service. 

 Every bean service must have an @Service annotation with a value identifying the service interface for the service.
 
== SwitchYard - Consuming a Bean service
In addition to providing a service in SwitchYard, beans can also consume other services. These services can be provided in the same application by other implementations, or they could be wired to gateway bindings to invoke services over JMS, SOAP, FTP, etc. The SwitchYard runtime handles the resolution of the service reference to a concrete service, allowing your service logic to remain blissfully ignorant. Invocations made through this reference are routed through the SwitchYard exchange mechanism.

[source,java]
----
@Inject @Reference
private SimpleService service;

public void consumeSomeService(String consumerName) {
   service.sayHello("Hello " + consumerName);
}
----

   By default, SwitchYard expects a service reference to be declared with a name which matches the Java type used for the reference. In the event where the service reference name is different from the type name of the contract, the @Reference annotation can accept a service name

[source,java]
----
@Inject @Reference("urn:com.example.services:SimpleService:1.0")
private SimpleService service;

public void consumeSomeService(String consumerName) {
   service.sayHello("Hello " + consumerName);
}
----

== SwitchYard - Reference Invoker
The default behavior of @Reference is to inject a reference using the Java interface of the reference contract. This is adequate for most cases, but it does not allow you to access SwitchYard API constructs like the Message and Context interfaces.  If you need to access to an attachment or a context property when invoking a reference from a Bean service, then you will want to use a ReferenceInvoker.  To use a ReferenceInvoker, all you need to do is replace the service contract interface type with a ReferenceInvoker type and SwitchYard will automatically inject the correct instance.

[source,java]
----
@Inject @Reference("urn:com.example.services:SimpleService:1.0")
private ReferenceInvoker service;

public void consumeSomeService(String consumerName) {
   service.newInvocation("sayHello")
      .setProperty("myHeader", "myValue")
      .invoke(consumerName);
}
----

 Note how the ReferenceInvoker instance is used to create a ReferenceInvocation using the newInvocation() method.  A new instance of ReferenceInvocation should be created each time you want to invoke a service using ReferenceInvoker.

== Switchyard - Camel Component
Camel services allow you to leverage the core routing engine inside of Apache Camel to route between services in SwitchYard.  All of the EIP and core routing support in Camel is available to your service implementation.  Each Camel route is exposed as a service within SwitchYard, which means it has a well-defined contract and can be injected into any other service in the runtime.

There are 2 implementations:

* Java DSL
* XML DSL

Tips:

* There is only one route per service. (More routes can be created, only one component entry point)
* The consumer or "from" endpoint in a route is always a "switchyard" endpoint and the endpoint name must equal the service name.  This is default behavior in the tooling.
* To consume other services from within your route, only use "switchyard" consumer (i.e. "to") endpoints. This keeps your routing logic independent of the binding details for consumed services.

== Switchyard - Camel Component Java DSL

[source,java]
----
package com.example.switchyard.docs;
 
import org.apache.camel.builder.RouteBuilder;
 
public class CamelServiceRoute extends RouteBuilder {
    /**
     * The Camel route is configured via this method.  The from:
     * endpoint is required to be a SwitchYard service.
     */
    public void configure() {
        // TODO Auto-generated method stub
        from("switchyard://Example").log(
                "Received message for 'Example' : ${body}");
    }
}
----

 There are no SwitchYard-specific classes or APIs used for Java DSL route; the route class is identical in signature to what you would use with Apache Camel directly.

== Switchyard - Camel Component XMl DSL

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ASCII"?>
<route xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring">
   <from uri="switchyard://Example"/>
   <log message="Example - message received: ${body}"/>
</route>
----

 The XML routing syntax is identical to what you would use with Apache Camel directly and conforms to the Camel schema for <route> definition

== Switchyard - Consuming services from Camel routes
Invoking another service from within your Camel route can be done by using the SwitchYard producer endpoint (switchyard://) within your route.  Endpoint configuration is very straightforward:

[source,java]
----
switchyard://[service-name]?operationName=[operation-name]
----

* *service-name*: name of the SwitchYard service. This value needs to match the name of a service reference defined on the service component for the route.
* *operation-name*: name of the service operation to be invoked. This is only used on references and is optional if the target service only has a single operation.

== SwitchYard - Scripting languages in Camel
Because of 3rd party dependencies, SwitchYard supports only following languages:

* BeanShell
* JavaScript
* Groovy
* Ruby
* Python

 Inside your script you will have access to predefined variables like request, response or exchange which will let you generate response.

== Switchyard - Camel CDI Integration
SwitchYard integrates the CDI Bean Manager with the Camel Bean Registry to allow you to reference CDI Beans in your Camel routes. Any Java class annotated with @Named in your application will be available through Camel's Bean registry.

[source,java]
----
@Named("StringSupport")
@ApplicationScoped
public class StringUtil {
 
    public String trim(String string) {
        return string.trim();
    }
}
----

[source,java]
----
public class ExampleBuilder extends RouteBuilder {
 
    public void configure() {
        from("switchyard://ExampleBuilder")
            .split(body(String.class).tokenize("\n"))
            .filter(body(String.class).startsWith("sally:"))
            .to("bean:StringSupport");
    }
}
----

== Switchyard - Message Composers
A MessageComposer can compose or decompose a native binding message to/from SwitchYard's canonical message.  A MessageComposer does this in three steps:

1. Construct a new target message instance.
2. Copy the content ("body") of the message.
3. Delegate the header/property mapping to a ContextMapper.

 We currently provide a SOAPMessageComposer, a CamelMessageComposer, and a HornetQMessageComposer.  These default implementations are used by their associated bindings, but can be overridden by the user.

 TODO: Check if more message composers exist (RESTeasyMessageCOmposer)

== Switchyard - Custom Message Composers

 TODO: Create this

== Switchyard - Context Mappers
A ContextMapper moves native binding message headers and/or properties to/from SwitchYard's canonical context.  

   Many ContextMapper implementations are provided OOTB).  These default implementations are used by their associated bindings, but can be overridden by the user.

* *SOAPContextMapper*: when processing an incoming SOAPMessage, takes the mime (in most cases, HTTP) headers from a soap envelope and maps them into the SwitchYard Context as Scope.MESSAGE properties with the SOAPComposition.SOAP_MESSAGE_MIME_HEADER label, and takes the soap header elements from the soap envelope and maps them into the SwitchYard Context as Scope.EXCHANGE properties with the SOAPComposition.SOAP_MESSAGE_HEADER label. When processing an outgoing SOAPMessage, it takes the SwitchYard Scope.OUT Context properties and maps them into mime (in most cases, HTTP) headers, and takes the SwitchYard Scope.EXCHANGE Context properties and maps them into the soap envelope as soap header elements.

* *CamelContextMapper*
* *HornetQContextMapper*
* *HTTPContextMapper*
* *RESTEasyContextMapper*
* *CCIIndexedRecordContextMapper*, *CCIMappedRecordContextMapper*, *JMSContextMapper* (JCA binding)

 TODO: Create this

== SwitchYard - Scopes

* Headers are scoped as MESSAGE. You will see some headers specifically useful for http requests, and other headers specifically useful for http responses.  In both cases, they are most likely tied to the binding's notion of an incoming message or an outgoing message.

* Properties are scoped as EXCHANGE, as this is most likely application or domain data, and possibly useful in the entire processing of the Exchange.

== SwitchYard - Transformations (Java, JAXB, JSON, Smooks, XSLT, ...)

When is a transformation required:

 When origin type and destination type of a "wire connection" is not of the same type, and implicit type conversion (provided by Camel type converters) can not convert between both types.

 Declarative transformation only kicks in when the runtime detects that the message type is different between the consumer and provider contracts.

The tooling reflects this as well, which is why if there are no interactions where contract types differ, then you cannot create a transformer. There are three scenarios in SY where the contract types can differ and require a transformation:
 
1. A composite service interface is different from the component service interface it promotes.
2. A component reference interface is different from the component service interface it is wired to.
3. A composite reference interface is different from the component reference interface it promotes.

* Different implementations for transformations:
** Java
** JAXB
** JSON
** Smooks
** XSLT
** Transformations in a Camel component
** Other (coming next: Dozer,...)

== SwitchYard - Transformations - Content Type Names

Since transformations occur between named types (i.e. from type A, to type B), it's important to understand how the type names are derived. The type of the message is determined based on the service contract, which can be WSDL or Java.

For WSDL interfaces, the message name is determined based on the fully-qualified element name of a WSDL message.  Take the following WSDL definition:

[source,xml]
----
<definitions xmlns:tns="urn:switchyard-quickstart:bean-service:1.0">  
  <message name="submitOrder">
    <part name="parameters" element="tns:submitOrder"/>
  </message>
  <portType name="OrderService">
    <operation name="submitOrder">
      <input message="tns:submitOrder"/>
    </operation>
  </portType>
</definitions>
----

This would yield the following message type name based on the message element name defined in the WSDL:

[source,java]
----
{urn:switchyard-quickstart:bean-service:1.0}submitOrder
----

When Java interfaces are used for the service contract, the message name consists of the full package name + the class name, prefixed with "java:".

[source,java]
----
package org.switchyard.example;
public interface OrderService {
    void submitOrder(Order order);
}
----

The message type name for the submitOrder method in this Java interface would be *"java:org.switchyard.example.Order"*.  

Occasionally, it can be useful to override the default operation name generated for a Java interface. The *@OperationTypes* annotation provides this capability by allowing the user to specify the input, output, and/or fault type names used for a Java service interface. 

For example, if we wanted to accept XML input content without any need for transformation to a Java object model, the OrderService interface could be changed to look like this:

[source,java]
----
package org.switchyard.example;
public interface OrderService {
    @OperationTypes(in = "{urn:switchyard-quickstart:bean-service:1.0}submitOrder")
    void submitOrder(String orderXML);
}
----

Aside from short-circuiting the requirement for transformation, this annotation can be useful if you want to maintain tight control over the names used for message content.

== SwitchYard - Transformations

Required transformations are automatically detected by IDE, but, if missing, can be created/deleted/recreated manually:

image::transformers/no_missing_transformer.png[All required validators have been added]

If you remove all/any of the transformers, you will be able to create missing required transformers:

image::transformers/required_transformers.png[Create required transformer]

A new dialog will let you create a new transformer:

image::transformers/new_transformer_all.png[New Transformer]

== SwitchYard - Transformations - Java
Java transformer let you do any kind of transformation using Java for this purpose. There are two methods available for creating a Java-based transformer in SwitchYard:

1. Implement the *org.switchyard.transform.Transfomer* interface and add a *<transform.java>* definition to your switchyard.xml.
2. Annotate one or more methods on your Java class with *@Transformer*.

 When using the @Transformer annotation, the SwitchYard maven plugin will automatically generate the <transform.java> definition(s) for you and add them to the switchyard.xml packaged in your application.

Implementing Java transformations is just a matter of creating a new (Java) Transformer on the SwitchYard application:

image::transformers/new_transformer.png[New validator]

And selecting Java as the type of transformer you want implementing class or bean.

image::transformers/new_java_transformer.png[Create a Java transformer]

It will create the appropiate transformer class/bean with the default annotated methods:

image::transformers/java_transformer.png[Java Transformer class]

 The optional from and to elements of the @Transformer annotation can be used to specify the qualified type name used during transformer registration.  If not supplied, the full class name of the method parameter will be used as the from type and the full class name of the return type will be used as the to type.

And the corresponding configuration in the switchyard.xml file:

image::transformers/transformer_switchyard_xml.png[Transformers defined in switchyard.xml file]

 The CDI bean name specified by @Named annotation is used to resolve transformer class. If you don't specify, then class name of the transformer is used instead.

== SwitchYard - Transformations - JAXB

The JAXB transformer allows you to perform Java to XML (and XML to Java) transformations using JAXB (XML marshalling and unmarshalling).

 JAXB Java models can be generated from an XML Schema using XJC, or from a WSDL using tools like wsconsume, or from within JBDS IDE with "JAXB`s JAXB classes from Schema" or "SwitchYard`s Java Files from WSDL".

JAXB Transformer requires a *to* and *from* with one Java type and one QNamed XML type, depending on whether you're performing a Java to XML or XML to Java transformation.

[source,java]
----
@XmlElementDecl(namespace = "http://com.acme/orders", name = "create")
public JAXBElement<CreateOrder> createOrder(CreateOrder value) {
    return new JAXBElement<Order>(_CreateOrder_QNAME, CreateOrder.class, null, value);
}
----

And the corresponding configuration in the switchyard.xml file:

image::transformers/jaxb_transformer_switchyard_xml.png[JAXB transformers defined in switchyard.xml file]


== SwitchYard - Transformations - JSON

The JSON transformer provides a basic mapping facility between POJOs and JSON (JSON marshalling and unmarshalling). The JSON specification of the transformer requires a to and from specification with one Java type and one QNamed JSON type, depending on whether you're performing a Java to JSON or JSON to Java transformation.

[source,java]
----
<transforms>
   <xform:transform.json from="java:org.switchyard.quickstarts.transform.json.OrderAck" 
                         to="{urn:switchyard-quickstart:transform-json:1.0}orderResponse"/>
   <xform:transform.json from="{urn:switchyard-quickstart:transform-json:1.0}order" 
                         to="java:org.switchyard.quickstarts.transform.json.Order"/>
</transforms>
----

== SwitchYard - Transformations - Smooks

There are three distinct transformation models available with Smooks in SwitchYard:

1. XML to Java :  Based on a standard Smooks Java Binding configuration.
2. Java to XML:   Based on a standard Smooks Java Binding configuration.
3. Smooks :  This is a "normal" Smooks transformation in which the developer must define which Smooks filtering Result is to be exported back to the SwitchYard Message as the transformation result.

Smooks transformations are declared by including a <transform.smooks> definition in switchyard.xml.

[source,xml]
----
<transform.smooks config="/smooks/OrderAck_XML.xml"
                  from="java:org.switchyard.quickstarts.transform.smooks.OrderAck"
                  to="{urn:switchyard-quickstart:transform-smooks:1.0}submitOrderResponse"

== SwitchYard - Transformations - XSLT

The XSLT transformer allows you to perform a transformation between 2 XML types, using an XSLT. It is configured simply by specifying the to and from QNames, as well as the path to the XSLT to be applied.

[source,xml]
----
<transforms>
   <transform.xslt xmlns="urn:switchyard-config:transform:1.0" 
                   from="{urn:switchyard-quickstart:transform-xslt:1.0}order" 
                   to="{urn:switchyard-quickstart:transform-xslt:1.0}orderAck" 
                   xsltFile="xslt/order.xslt"/>
</transforms>
----

And an xslt file is requierd for transformation:
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
	version="1.0">
	<xsl:template match="/">

== SwitchYard - Validations (Java validations, XML Validation)
Validation feature provides a functionality for message content validation.

* Different implementations for validators:
** Java
** XML
** Other (to be coming...)

We often need to perform message validation before processing its data in service logic, but implementing the validation logic directly in the consumer or provider pollutes the service logic and can lead to tight coupling.  SwitchYard allows for the validation logic to be declared outside the service logic and injected into the mediation layer at runtime.

Validation of message content is specified in the descriptor of your SwitchYard application (switchyard.xml). The qualified name of the type being validated name is defined along with the validator implementation.

== SwitchYard - Java validations

Implementing Java validation is just a matter of creating a new (Java) Validator on the SwitchYard application:

image::validators/new_validator.png[New validator]

And selecting type you want to validate and implementing class or bean.

image::validators/java_validator.png[Create a Java validator]

It will create the appropiate configuration in the switchyard.xml file:

image::validators/validator_switchyard_xml.png[Validator defined in switchyard.xml file]

And the appropiate class/bean needs to be created (manually), with the correspongin annotations (*@Named* and *@Validator*):

image::validators/annotated_validator.png[Annotated validator]

Validation methods should return an instance of *import org.switchyard.validate.ValidationResult*.

There is a helper class for validation called: *org.switchyard.validate.BaseValidator* that provides with methods for *validResult()* and *invalidResult(...)*

 TODO: Create this

== SwitchYard - Properties

 TODO: Create this

== SwitchYard - Environment Properties

Environment properties allow you to replace any attribute or element value in switchyard.xml with a property from the runtime environment. The syntax for a replaced token is "${varName}" where "varname" is your property name. The configuration layer in SwitchYard is configured with instances of PropertyResolver, which are used to resolve the value of a property based on its name.

=== Where to define Environment Properties
Property values are resolved from the following locations:

* System properties passed by -D option of Java VM like "-Dproperty.name=property.value"
* System environment variables, referenced with an "env." prefix, for example: env.PATH
* Unit test properties
* JBoss AS7 properties, including access into the SecurityVault
* Domain properties in switchyard.xml
* SCA property definitions in the composite or component

=== Property overriding
SwitchYard property resolver scans the property in following order.

* System properties and System environment variables
* Unit test properties
* JBoss AS7 properties
* Domain properties
* SCA composite properties
* SCA component properties

 You can specify the default property value with "${propertyName:defaultValue}" syntax where "propertyName" is the name of property.

=== Property escaping
Sometimes, the desired value for a property needs to be in the same "dollar curly" syntax which triggers SwitchYard's property substitution. This can be problematic because in these cases, you want SwitchYard to leave the configured value alone. To accomplish this, use a "double dollar curly" syntax instead.

[source,xml]
----
<foo value="${prop}"/>
<bar value="$${prop}"/>
----

Assuming the value "prop" is a resolvable property (say, equal to "test"), the value attribute of the foo element will be that value ("test").  However, the value attribute of the bar element will be "${test}" (with one dollar sign).

== SwitchYard - Implementation Properties
Implementation properties allow you to inject one or more property values into a service implementation.

This is based on the property support in the SCA assembly spec. Since the property is injected into service implementation logic, the injection mechanism itself is unique to each implementation type. 

* *Java*: injected using @Property into a CDI bean
* *Camel*: wired into Camel properties component and accessible in a Camel route using Camel's own varName property notation
* *BPEL*: mapped into process variables via an <assign> with using resolveProperty() XPath custom function
* *BPMN 2*: inserted into process variables by data input associations
* *Drools*: available in a global map

 TODO: Create this

== SwitchYard - Implementation Properties - Bean
Implementation properties represent environmental properties that you have defined in the SwitchYard application descriptor (switchyard.xml) for your bean implementation.  To access these properties, simply add an @Property annotation to your bean class identifying the property you want to inject. The following example demonstrates injection of a "user.name" property:

[source,java]
----
@Service(SimpleService.class)
public class SimpleServiceBean implements SimpleService {
 
   @Property(name="user.name")
   private String name;
 
   public String sayHello(String message) {
      return "Hello " + name + ", I got a message: " + message;
   }
}
----

== SwitchYard - Implementation Properties - Camel
SwitchYard integrates with the Properties Component in Camel to make system and application properties available inside your route definitions. You can inject properties into your camel route using "{{propertyName}}" expression where "propertyName" is the name of the property.

[source,xml]
----
<route xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring" id="CamelTestRoute">
   <log message="ItemId [${body}]"/>
   <to uri="switchyard://WarehouseService?operationName=hasItem"/>
   <log message="Title Name [${body}]"/>
   <log message="Properties [{{user.name}}]"/>
</route>
----

== SwitchYard - Invocation Properties
It is information relative to the invocation or current execution. It is carried along the SwitchYard Context.

== SwitchYard - Invocation Properties - Bean Components
There can be situations where you need to access contextual information like message headers (e.g. received file name) in your implementation. To facilitate this, the Bean component allows you to access the SwitchYard Exchange Context instance associated with a given Bean Service Operation invocation. To get a reference to the Context, simply add a Context property to your bean and annotate it with the CDI @Inject annotation.

[source,java]
----
@Service(SimpleService.class)
public class SimpleServiceBean implements SimpleService {
 
@Inject
private Context context;
 
public String sayHello(String message) {
        System.out.println("*** Funky Context Property Value: " + context.getPropertyValue("funkyContextProperty"));
        return "Hi there!!";
    }
}
----

 The Context interface allows your bean logic to get and set properties in the context.  Note that you can only make calls on the Context instance within the scope of one of the Service Operation methods. Invoking it outside this scope will result in an UnsupportedOperationException being thrown.

== SwitchYard - Policies (transaction, )
Policy allows you to control the runtime behavior of a service in a declarative manner, independent of the service implementation and binding details.

1. Specifying a list of security policies that are required for that service.
2. Configuring application-level security processing details for the services within a domain.
3. Configuring system-level security processing details.
4. Storing sensitive information, such as passwords, in the JBoss AS password vault.

 TODO: Create this

== SwitchYard - Clustering
There are two fundamental building blocks to the clustering support in SwitchYard:

* *Shared Runtime Registry*: a shared, distributed runtime registry which allows individual instances to publish and query service endpoint details.
* *Remote Communication Channels*: an internal communication protocol used to allow a service client to invoke a service hosted in a remote instance.

image::clustering.jpg[Clustering]

The runtime registry is backed by a replicated Infinispan cache.  Each instance in a cluster points to the same replicated cache.  When a node joins a cluster, it immediately has access to all remote service endpoints published in the registry.  If a node leaves the cluster due to failure or shutdown, all service endpoint registrations are immediately removed for that node.  The registry is not persisted, so manually clean-up and maintenance is not required.  Note that the shared registry is a runtime registry and not a publication registry, which means the registry's lifecycle and state is tied to the current state of deployed services within a cluster.  This is in contrast to a publication registry (e.g. UDDI), where published endpoints are independent from the runtime state of the ESB.

The communications channel is a private intra-cluster protocol used by instances to invoke a remote service.  The channel is currently based on HTTP, but this may change in the future and should be considered a transparent detail of the clustering support in SwitchYard.

 TODO: REVIEW this

== SwitchYard - Configuring Clustering
Clustering support is light on configuration and should work out of the box.  The only real requirements are using a shared Infinispan cache for the runtime registry and indicating which services are clustered in your application config (switchyard.xml).  By default, SwitchYard uses the default cache in the "cluster" cache container which comes pre-defined in your standalone-ha.xml.  Unless you have specific requirements to use a different cache or separate cache configuration, just stick with the default.

Applications take advantage of clustering by explicitly identifying which services should be clustered in the application's descriptor (switchyard.xml).  You can control which services in your application will be published in the cluster's runtime registry and which references can be resolved by clustered services.  To enable a service to be published in the cluster's runtime registry, promote the service in your application and add a <binding.sca> with clustering enabled to it.

[source,xml]
----
<sca:service name="Goodbye" promote="GoodbyeBean/Goodbye">   
   <sca:interface.java interface="com.example.Goodbye"/>
   <sca:binding.sca sy:clustered="true"/>
</sca:service>
----

Consuming services in a cluster follows the same configuration approach, but applies to references in your application.  To invoke a service in a cluster, promote the reference and add an SCA binding with clustering enabled.

[source,xml]
----
<sca:reference name="Goodbye" multiplicity="0..1" promote="GreetingBean/Goodbye">
   <sca:interface.java interface="com.example.Goodbye"/>
   <sca:binding.sca sy:clustered="true"
</sca:reference>
----

 TODO: REVIEW this

== SwitchYard - Using Clustering
To create a cluster of SwitchYard instances, start two or more AS 7 instances with a shared Infinispan cache.  Out-of-the-box configuration in standalone-ha.xml should be sufficient:

[source,bash]
----
# start instance 1
node1> bin/standalone.sh -c standalone-ha.xml -Djboss.node.name=node1
# start instance 2
node2> bin/standalone.sh -c standalone-ha.xml -Djboss.node.name=node2 -Djboss.socket.binding.port-offset=1000
----

Once the instances are up, you can deploy applications independently to each instance.  A homogeneous cluster would have identical applications deployed on each node.  A heterogeneous cluster will have different applications and services deployed on each instance. For testing purposes, it's easiest to deploy a consumer application to one instance and a provider application to another.
