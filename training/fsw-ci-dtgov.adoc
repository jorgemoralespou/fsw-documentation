== Continuous Delivery with FSW
FSW is a great product, and incorporates in the suite a Governance solution for services lifecycle. We usually don't have a clear picture of how to map this product to user requirements, and how to integrate into the customer environments or way of doing things.
What I describe here are some examples of use cases that can be done with DTGov to enable Continuous Delivery of services for a customer. Of course, these are just examples, and every customer/organization will have their specific concerns or tools or way of working, so this process *ALWAYS* needs to be tailored for the customer. But you can use these examples to get into the conversation with the customer.

== Tag Final version after all testing phases
This example here assumes the customer will go through all their testing phases using a "Snapshot" or not "final" version of the artifact, and will tag it as Final just when the artifact is ready to be promoted to the production environment. If testing at some point fails, version will not be bumped.

. Developer commit/pushes their development to the VCS (Version Control System) they are using (Git, SVN,...)
.. To note that developer will use artifact repository to fetch dependencies. For this example, it will use Nexus for released versions and dtGov for snapshots. (An option can be to have nexus proxy to dtGov for the Snapshots)
. Continuous Integration server fetches latest code from VCS and trigger the execution of the build job that will build and do unit tests on the code. If everything works fine, and all tests pass, it will deploy the generated artifact to DTGov via maven deployment API.
. DTGov will start executing the configured workflow for this kind of service.
.. DTGov can have multiple workflows for different kind of services.
. DTGov will deploy/install/copy the artifact to the target environment with the configured deployment process (Using maven, JBoss cli, file copy or JON)
. Workflow will be in waiting state for the configured used to functional validate the development in the corresponding environment (dev in this example).
. Once the user has validated the development doing the pertinent functional/integration/performance/xxx tests it will approve or reject the task in "DTGov task inbox" which will trigger a finish of the workflow (in case of reject) or continue the workflow (in cse of approve).
.. Bundled workflow (OOTB) sends an email notification with the result of the approval/rejection action taken.
. DTGov workflow continues (in case of approval) and it will deploy to next configured environment, and will create a task for the corresponding user.
. Corresponding user will validate the development, as before.
. User will approve or reject, as before. And so forth with every environment but the last one.
. This example assumes that no automatic deployment can be made to production systems, so part of the workflow, the corresponding to "PROD" environment, will trigger a job in the CI server to release the software (development) and do whatever is appropriate for the task.
. This CI release job, will tag the version in the VCS used.
. It will build the tagged version and it will deploy it to the Artifact repository to the released group for the corresponding project. This way, artifact is accessible.
. Ops guy (team) will get the artifact from the artifact repository
. And it will install it to the "PROD" environment with their "Pass to Production" procedures.

== Tag Final version before all testing phases
 
This example here assumes the customer will go through all their testing phases using a tagged version of the artifact. If testing at some point fails, version will be bumped, and a version that will never get into production will have been produced.

== DT With FSW CAVEATS
* As I said, there is no golden rule on how to do CI/CD with DTGov. Every SCM (Software Configuration Management) tools has their specifics, and these here presented are shown to be valid with Jenkins as CI server, Git as VCS and Nexus as artifact repository.
* Deployment process can be more complicated than what is here expressed, as SwitchYard doesn't allow yet for domain mode (as of FSW 6.0.0), so installation of the artifact to the environment can be tricky. If using JON, things seem simpler.
* Configuration of development station has to be taken into account and configured accordingly to their artifact repository and to the way of grouping their dependencies.
* Even DTGov can be used as maven server for artifact dependencies, we assume for this workflow that nexus will be the single source of "Final" artifacts, as this simplifies maven "settings.xml" configuration for developers. Nexus can proxy DTGov as a named repository.
* This is an example based on the OOTB workflow with the difference that promotion to Prod environment is not automatic. (As I have yet to see a company that does allow for automatic deployment to prod systems, so I feel this is more realistic).
